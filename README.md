# obstacleavoiding
INTRODUCTION

The bot is made using ultrasonic sensor and it is controlled by Arduino microcontroller. Ultrasonic sensor fixed in front portion of the bot vehicle. ... This vehicle is used for detecting obstacle and avoiding the collision. The goal of our project is to create a autonomous robot which intelligently detects the obstacle in his path and navigate according to the actions we set for it.

BASIC REQUIREMENTS
The sonic waves emitted by the transducer are reflected by an object and received back in the transducer. After having emitted the sound waves, the ultrasonic sensor will switch to receive mode. The time elapsed between emitting and receiving is proportional to the distance of the object from the sensor.
 
Ultrasonic sensor are devices that use electricalâ€“mechanical energy transformation to measure distance from the sensor to the target object. Ultrasonic waves are longitudinal mechanical waves which travel as a sequence of compressions and rarefactions along the direction of wave propagation through the medium.
    			 

APPLICATIONS
OBSTACLE DETECTION FOR MINING VEHICLE, DRIVERLESS VEHICLES RUNNING ALONG BEAMS.
